# 2022 EPFL Machine Learning - Higgs Boson Challenge

### Authors: Laurynas Lopata, Eloi Eynard, Aurélien Texier


## Description
In this project we are analyzing the dataset provided by CERN.
In 2013 this dataset was used in the discovery of the Higgs boson, which was vital in understanding the world surrounding us. We 
emulate this discovery process by estimating the likelihood that a 
given event’s signature is the result of a Higgs boson (signal) or
some other process/particle (background). 
We implement **machine learning** methods to predict whether a collision was a signal.

## This repo contains:
- implementions.py which contains the 6 basic machine learning methods 
- run.py file which correspond the implementation which gave us the best accuracy
- cleanup_helpers.py which contains the methods used for cleaning up the data in run.py
- other helper functions for finding the best parameters and doing visualization
- ML_project1.pdf : 2 pages report of the project 1 which explain our methods
