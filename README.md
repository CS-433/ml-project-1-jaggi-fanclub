# mll-team-projects. Project 1 
2022 EPFL machine learning group projects

In this project we are analyzing the dataset provided by CERN.
In 2013 this dataset was used in the discovery of the Higgs boson, which was vital in understanding the world surrounding us. We 
emulate this discovery process by estimating the likelihood that a 
given eventâ€™s signature is the result of a Higgs boson (signal) or
some other process/particle (background). 
We implement **machine learning** methods to predict whether a collision was a signal.

In this repo, there are 
- the implementions.py which contains the 6 basic machine learning methods 
- the run.py file which correspond to our best accuracy prediction
- Helper functions for processing the data and vizualisation
- The report.pdf : 2 pages report of the project 1 which explain our methods.
